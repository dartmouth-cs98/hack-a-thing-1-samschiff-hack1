## Fun Run: Create a Spotify Playlist based on your own songs with the same tempo ##

* My first react native app
* I used expo and the expo app template to get started
* I used express for the backend which I already knew
* I created the frontend and backend of the app on two local directories to make testing easier before moving them to here

## How to run the app ##
* Backend is on Heroku at https://morning-plains-92296.herokuapp.com
* Front end
* npm install
* npm start

## What I learned ##
* React Native is much more complex than React. Because of the fact that it is for a mobile device, there were many more complexities that I had to deal with to get this to work.
* How to interact with Spotify's API.  The authentication was especially interesting because I had to combine Expo's authentication with Spotify's.  Redirecting from the app and dealing with the 
* How to put cool looking icons into my app!

## What didn't work ## 
* The popup that links to the playlist is broken right now.  I hope to fix it after the project is due.  The playlist is still made, it's just the link that fails.
* I had a lot of trouble with the pop ups in general.  Sometimes they wouldn't pop up all the way or close correctly. I think at this point most of them work but every time I test the app it's a toss up.
* I spent a lot of time on the structure of the app so it's lacking styling right now.
