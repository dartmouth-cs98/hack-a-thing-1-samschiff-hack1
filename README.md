## Fun Run: Create a Spotify Playlist based on your own songs with the same tempo ##

* My first react native app
* I used expo and the expo app template to get started
* I used express for the backend which I already knew
* I created the frontend and backend of the app on two local directories to make testing easier before moving them to here

## How to run the app ##
* Backend is on Heroku at https://morning-plains-92296.herokuapp.com
* Front end
* npm install
* npm start
