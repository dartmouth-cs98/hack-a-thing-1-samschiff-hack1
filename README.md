## Fun Run: Create a Spotify Playlist based on your own songs with the same tempo ##

* My first react native app
* I used expo and the expo app template to get started
* I used express for the backend which I already knew
* I created the frontend and backend of the app on two local directories to make testing easier before moving them to here

## How to run the app ##
* Backend is on Heroku at https://morning-plains-92296.herokuapp.com
* Front end
* npm install
* npm start

## What I learned ##
* react native is much more complex than React. Because of the fact that it is for a mobile device, there were many more complexities that I had to deal with to get this to work.

## What didn't work ## 
* I had a lot of trouble with the pop ups.  Sometimes they wouldn't pop up all the way or close correctly. I think at this point most of them work but every time I test the app it's a toss up.
